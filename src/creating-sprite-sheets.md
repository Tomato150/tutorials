# Creating Sprite Sheets

We were somewhat dismayed that Pixi.js uses a proprietary commercial app to build sprite sheets.
We rely solely on open source tools, so we built an open source filter for our node.js build tool---[Projmate](http://projmate.github.io).
The `pm-spritesheet` filter generates sprite sheets and a JSON meta file compatible with Texture Packer (as used by pixi.js).

In this tutorial four images

![](examples/img/tp/eggHead.png)
![](examples/img/tp/flowerTop.png)
![](examples/img/tp/helmlok.png)
![](examples/img/tp/skully.png)

are combined into a single sprite sheet. These images are from pixi.js' `Example 2`.

### Installing Projmate

Projmate is command-line build tool we use internally for almost half a year now
that works well in Linux, Mac and Windows.  In order to use it, first install
these pre-requisites

*   [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
*   [node.js + npm](http://nodejs.org/)

Install Projmate globally

    npm install -g projmate-cli@0.1.0-dev

Inside a project install the sprite sheet filter

    npm install pm-spritesheet


### Generate Sprite Sheet Task

Projmate, like most build tools, breaks down a project into smaller units of work called tasks that can
depend on each other. What is different about Projmate is that a task is defined by one or more pipelines which
define behaviour for `development`, `test` and `production` mode.  For example, in `production` mode a task can
minify, compress, add a banner, optimize, etc.

In this example, we want to generate a sprite sheet from all the `tp/*.png` files pixi.js' second example
folder

    â–¾ tp/
        eggHead.png
        flowerTop.png
        helmlok.png
        skully.png

First create a build file `Projfile.js` at the root of your
project. The pipeline for `spritesheet` task requires only
the `spritesheet` filter which is passed all files matching `files`.
`spritesheet` filter then retrieves dimensions for each image and
determines an eficient layout then generates the image and meta file.

<div class='note'>
Projmate has many filters: CoffeeScript, CommonJS, PreProcessor,
Template, Handlebars, Uglify, Less, YUI Docs, ... to name a few
</div>

```js
exports.project = function(pm) {
  var f = pm.filters(require('pm-spritesheet'));

  return {
    spritesheet: {
      files: 'tp/*.png',
      dev: [
        f.spritesheet({filename: 'SpriteSheet.png', root: 'tp/', jsonStyle:'texturePacker'})
      ]
    }
  };

};
```

To run the `spritesheet` task from the terminal

    pm run spritesheet

The generated sprite sheet and JSON meta file is supported by pixi.js. We'll
cover this in a future example.

The only caveat is `Projmate` is not well documented as a small team can only do so much. Look at this
project's `Projfile.coffee` which has the `spritesheet` task for this tutorial.
